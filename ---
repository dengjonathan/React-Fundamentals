React components need to have a render method that is a *pure function*, meaning that the render method
  * can't have an state
  * can't make AJAX requests
  * should just recieve state/ props as arguments passed to the component and render UI

So how does react do all the things an app needs to be able to do?

Life Cycle methods are special methods each component can have that allow us to update views when specific conditions happen.

Life Cycle mthods in 2 categories:
1. When component mounted/unmounted to DOM
2. When a compnent recieves updated state data
